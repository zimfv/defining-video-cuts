# Description
In that project I try to build model, which can define cuts in video.


# Data Sources
I've downloaded videos from Youtube and cut them by Kdenlive.

|  | file | clip name | youtube link |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | videos/0.mp4 | Rammstein - Du Hast | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W3q8Od5qJio |
| 1 | videos/1.mp4 | Rammstein - Rosenrot | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=af59U2BRRAU |
| 2 | videos/2.mp4 | Rammstein - Sonne | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StZcUAPRRac |


There are disolve and dip to white/black transitions in source videos. I don't label the first as cut, but for the second that's possible to see where exactly shot changes, so I labeled them as cuts almost accurate.

The example of cut with dip to black transition you can see in `pics/dipToBlack_cuts0.png`.
